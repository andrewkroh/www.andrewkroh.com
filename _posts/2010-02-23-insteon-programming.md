Insteon is a home automation networking technology by SmartLabs. It is a
reliable protocol with communication over home power wiring or RF. The protocol
is backwards compatible with X10.

Communication with the devices on the network is done through Insteon modems
which are plugged into the power wiring or send RF signals and provide a
interface to a computer via Serial, USB, or Ethernet.

SmartLabs offers and SDK for Insteon, but I found the documentation below
publicly available on the internet and believe it is sufficient enough to
program to an Insteon modem.
