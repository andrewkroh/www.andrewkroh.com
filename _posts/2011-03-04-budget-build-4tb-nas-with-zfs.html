<p>This system is a replacement for an older and much smaller NAS I put together from old parts. The old system was 32-bit based and lacked onboard SATA support because it was manufactured before SATA was in existance. The 1TB limitation on 32-bit Solaris makes upgrading to larger drives a silly move. Why purchase a 1TB drive when you can purchase a 2TB drive for 10 dollars more?</p>
<p>The new system is a 64-bit dual core AMD running at 3.1GHz with 4GB of memory. The system disks which hold the OS and other essential data are configured in a ZFS mirror for redundancy. I've found that most of my Solaris installations with all the random server software I use normally consume about 30GB; the disks I bought hold 160GB and should be more than sufficient. With 6 SATA ports available on the motherboard and one used by the DVD drive and two used by the system disks I have room to support three SATA disks for data storage. Additional data drives can be added later by using a PCI-e SATA&#47;SAS add-on card. For more information on Solaris compatible SATA&#47;SAS cards see this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.zorinaq.com&#47;?e=10">excellent blog post<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>The three data drives are 2TB. Simple math says this system can hold 6TB of data, but that would be without redundancy and would offer no protection against a disk failure. To gain protection against a single disk failure the disks are setup in a RAID-Z1 configuration which gives us 4TB of usable space.
