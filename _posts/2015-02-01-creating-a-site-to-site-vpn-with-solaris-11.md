I documented the process I used to create a site-to-site VPN between two sites
using Solaris 11 as the router. I did this because the
[documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1453/ipsec-mgtasks-vpn-2.html)
provided by Oracle has several critical flaws.

Here's the direct link to the document that's embedded below:
