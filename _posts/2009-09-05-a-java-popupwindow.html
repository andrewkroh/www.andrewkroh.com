<p>Have you ever wanted to display a popup to enter text or choose a color? Well if you have then you probably know that Swing does not have a component with this functionality. There is the JPopupMenu, but if you add components to it that menu will become hidden when any of the added components gain focus. I created a new component that displays a JPanel within a JWindow. The JWindow will hide itself when it loses focus, a click occurs outside of the JWindow, or the JWindow's ancestor moves. A demo is worth a 1000 words. The demo was inspired by the SMS button on Google Voice.</p>
